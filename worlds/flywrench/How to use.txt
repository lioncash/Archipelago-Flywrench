1. Check out archipelago via git in a fork: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago

2. Place all of the files into its own folder in the worlds director
   e.g. worlds/flywrench

3. Make the client and make a mod patch to make flywrench work with archipelago (hard part)
   NOTE: Consider looking at the undertale stuff in the repo, considering it also uses
         GameMaker, like Flywrench. (so, the Undertale world folder and UndertaleClient.py in the root)

         For modding and inspecting the game, use UndertaleModTool (https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool/releases)
         Despite the name, it's essentially THE GameMaker game inspection software. Also lets you add assets/functions/variables
         etc and save and apply everything (very good for making a patch file to distribute with the randomizer if mods are needed)


=== What the current code does ===

Ideally the current code just sets up every level goal/warp to be a check.
It adds no restrictions on the actual planet access.

Ideally once the randomizing Just Works with that, then additional options can
be added, like shuffling individual planet access into other people's worlds.

This could also incorporate the rudimentary line randomizer that Sarth worked on as
an option to the overall archipelago randomizer.
